# Theofany Blessing Gladysia Purwanta

Hello, my name is Theofany Blessing Gladysia Purwanta and Gladys is my nickname. I am a student majoring in Informatics, specializing in Artificial Intelligence at Ciputra University Makassar. I have a deep interest in technology and how artificial intelligence can change the way we live and work. With this I believe that AI has great potential to solve various complex problems in various fields, from health to transportation. Currently I live in a dormitory or boarding house, this is because I come from an area far from the capital city of Makassar, so I decided to just live in a dormitory. Since I was in school, I have been actively involved in several organizations and committee activities on campus. From there I can learn how important time management and good cooperation in a team are.
